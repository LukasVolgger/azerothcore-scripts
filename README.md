## FAQ

***"Which script do I need to use for which faction?"***

| ID  | Faction   |
|-----|-----------|
| 1   | Alliance  |
| 2   | Horde     |
| 3   | Both      |

***"Why not using lvl 255 for admin characters?"***

If druids are more than lvl 100, the client will crash when opening the character window. So I decided to keep the default wotlk level cap.
